# ArctusMajor
Follow the exciting development journey of [@mcprog](https://github.com/mcprog) and [@mkyprice](https://github.com/mkyprice) as they
create the *open-world rougue-lite* you always dreamed of. It wasn't possible in the 70's, now it is! We haven't forgotten about this
treasured, but semi-forgotten genre.

### What's going on?
We are making a video-game. No, it is not out yet. We don't know when it will be released. This is merely the project page.

### Can I playtest the game?
We are not ready for beta testers at this time. However, the `dist/` folder contains an `.exe` of the latest build. This is **not**
guaranteed to be a stable build. We will not be releasing verified builds at this time.

### What does the game look like?
All assets are subject to change. So while `textures/` contains the current textures we are using, we may change these assets in the future.
Generally, a *pixel-art* style with a modern twist can be expected ofr this game's art style.
